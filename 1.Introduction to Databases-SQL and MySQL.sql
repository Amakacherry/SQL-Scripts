# INTRODUCTION TO DATABASES- SQL AND MYSQL
/* SQL is used because the language is intuitive and used to process/solve sophisticated tasks
WHY STUDY SQL?
If you need to work with large data, you need to retrieve, if you work as a BI, web developer, Data Scientist, DBA;
These jobs require working with large amount of data and you have to retrieve the data in a clean accurate way. That is why you need SQL.alter
SQL means Structured Query Language. It's a programming language specifically designed for working with databases. It allows you to create,
manipulate, and share data, especially from data from Relational Database Management System. 

The way to tell the computer to extract information from a DataBase is by writing queries. It is a piece of code inducing a computer to execute 
a certain operation that will deliver the desired output. It is called querying the Database.

1. A programming language specifically designed for working with databases.
2. Allows you to write queries that the computer can execute and then provide database insights in return.
	It is an intuitive easy to learn language, but it's not easy to use. It's used for business problems involving the processing
of large amounts of data.
It's powerful to complete difficult tasks.

Best Programming Languages:
1. Java Script  2. SQL

To implement SQL, you need a DBMS or platform. For the software; There's MySQL, Oracle, SQlite, Microsoft SQL server, MariaDB etc. 
They are all the same with slight differences but the same principle.
MySQL is reliable, mature, and open-source(free). It is used by FB, Youtube, booking.com, linkedin, Twitter, pinterest etc.
 
# INTRODUCTION TO DATABASES:
The concepts encountered in Databases are interelated. You write efficient queries by learning Databases. Each data value in a row form a record.
A Field is a column in a table that contains specific information about every record in the table. When your table contains rows and columns,
you are dealing with stored tabular data. When we have several tables, relational algebra allows us to use mathematical logic and create a relation
between a few tables to retrieve data efficiently. 
A few related tables form a relational database. The smallest unit that can contain a meaningful set of data is called an entity. The rows 
are the horizontal entity while the columns are the vertical entity. The table is a bigger data entity or a database object.
A single row or horizontal entity can also be called an entity instance.
